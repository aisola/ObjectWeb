ObjectWeb: OOP Python Web Framework
===================================

ObjectWeb is a fast, minimalist, pure-Python web framework that relies on no third party libraries. It is designed around using Python as it was originally intended to be used: as an Object Oriented Programming language. ObjectWeb supports the CGI and WSGI standards and has a built-in development server.

### Technical Information

	There is currently no reliance on third party libraries.  
	Python Standard Libraries: os, re, cgi, sys, Cookie, urllib, itertools, wsgiref (make_server & CGIHandler)


### Documentation
